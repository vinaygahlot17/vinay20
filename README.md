This project aims to build a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.172% of the transactions being fraudulent.

Project Overview The main steps involved in this project are:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to identify patterns, relationships, and trends using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, standardization, and removing outliers.  Dealing with Imbalanced Data: Apply appropriate techniques to balance the dataset, as it is highly imbalanced.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to improve the performance of machine learning models.   
Model Selection: Choose the most appropriate machine learning model for the problem.    
Model Training: Split the data into train and test sets, and use the train set to estimate the best model parameters.
Model Validation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set to estimate its ability to generalize to unseen data and identify potential issues such as overfitting.
Model Deployment: Prepare the trained model for deployment in a production environment.
